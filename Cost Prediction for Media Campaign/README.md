Convenient Food Mart wants to predict the cost spent for acquiring a customer to improve its current marketing strategy 
and promote the stores through different media types. The company wants to analyze what media and promotion worked well 
in bringing in the customer, and wants to gain insights on how to do future campaigns.

Convenient Food Mart (CFM) is a chain of convenience stores in the United States selling a wide range of products 
including frozen and canned food, grocery, vegetables, household items and hygiene and healthcare items.
The private company's headquarters are located in Mentor, Ohio, and there are currently approximately 325 stores located in the US. 
Convenient Food Mart operates on the franchise system. Food Mart wants to analyze its cost spent on media campaign and predict 
the cost for acquiring a customer through promotion on various different medias, and find valuable learning for future campaigns.

# Objectives
The objective is to device a machine learning model to predict the cost spent on acquiring a customer through different
media marketing platforms and to gain insights on the how the current marketing strategy is efficient in bring in the customer. 

## Dataset Description 
Dataset consists of the several variables providing information about the stores with more than 60 thousand four hundred and twenty eight rows present as data, 
it has 40 columns.This is also the most vital set of information which would be used to segregate for train test split function later in order to check the accuracy.

## Scope 
The model will help the food mart to predict cost for acquiring customers.The food marts would be able to keep investing for acquiring customers via media 
with the model to acquire the valuable customers.


## Approach
Our approach to the business problem involves Data understanding, Data pre-processing and Exploratory data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset we have obtained, 
and understanding the dependency of features onto the prediction of cost for acquiring  customers. Moving further, we plan to predict the cost by deploying 
supervised learning regression machine learning models for higher accuracy in the prediction

# Limitation

The main problem with food marts is that they invest in outdated media types to attract customers, despite the fact that we can forecast
outcomes better with these media types. The projection for the new media type will be challenging because markets are shifting toward 
digital media. So, if the food marts invest in new digital media types, their odds of attracting customers will be lesser than they 
would be with traditional media types
